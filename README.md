# Adapting Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging Domains

This project is from my freshman year summer at Columbia and it aimed to show that diffusion models, in this case, denoising diffusion probabilistic models, can be used in the generation of in radiological scans of normal and diseased individuals in the NIH chest x-ray datasetâ€”and as a result augment the dataset. The results were used to train an ensemble of binary classifiers which were then made intepretable using [integrated gradients from the paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3305890.3306024).

The dataset used to train the diffusion models is based on that gathered by the NIH and contains over 112,000 anonymized frontal-view chest radiographs from more than 30,000 patients.
